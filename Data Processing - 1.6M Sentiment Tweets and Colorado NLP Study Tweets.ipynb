    "\"Our approach was unique because our training data was automatically created, as opposed to having humans manual annotate tweets. In our approach, we assume that any tweet with positive emoticons, like :), were positive, and tweets with negative emoticons, like :(, were negative. We used the Twitter Search API to collect these tweets by using keyword search\"\n",
